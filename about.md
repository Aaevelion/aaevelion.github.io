		<p>Hey! Nice to meet you. I am Rajnil Mukherjee, a 4th year physics major doing my undergrad at the <a href = "https://www.iisermohali.ac.in/"> Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Mohali </a>, Punjab, India. I was born and brought up in the beautiful city of Kolkata, and completed my high school from there itself. I am an aspiring astrophysicist and the drummer in my college rock band. I was previously the co-convener of Turing--the Computer Club of IISER Mohali, and I try to be actively associated with the activities of the club. </p>

				<p>As said before, I am an aspiring astrophysicst. However, unlike other astro geeks out there, my GK is very bad, so don't expect me to go answer queries like what that star is--I don't know okay? Catalogues are there for a reason. I am completing my physics major, and you can learn more about my projects and experiences here:</p>

					<h3>What's up?</h3>
				</header>
				<p>I am right now in the SE of France, in Nice. And no I am not vacationing--I am not rich ok :') ? I am working at the Lagrange Laboratory of the Cote d'Azure Observatory with Dr Remi Adam for my MS Thesis project, required as per the course curriculum at IISER M. The administrative gymnastics were worth it: beautiful city and wonderful people :D
				<br>
				I will be back in India by the end of November though, hence it's not that peeps at IISER/Kolkata won't be seeing me around anymore :) So yeah, *a bientot!*

				PS: You _can_ say I am in the middle of a "workation" maybe :P

				<p>Sometimes I wish I was. I am a very avid drummer, and play with my friends as a part of a band (Ulysses) in my college. We recently won 3rd in IICM (Inter IISER Cultural Meet) 2023 Battle of Bands, wherein contingents from all the 7 IISERs, along with IISc, NISER and CEBS, participate ( :) ).  I also dabble in front-end web development, and watch a lot of anime. I used to read a lot too, but it kind of stopped sometime during my +2. However, I have started picking it up since Bangalore, so less gooo!  </p>
