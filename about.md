## Hi. I am Rajnil

Currently a 2nd year BS-MS student here @ IISER Mohali, I am an aspiring astrophysicist with a penchant for many other things. 

Oh, my full name is Rajnil Mukherjee, and I come from the beautiful city of Kolkata. My hobbies include coding, drumming, and watching anime. Right now I am one of the co-conveners of Turing, the computer science club here at IISER M.
