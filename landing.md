		<p>Hey! Nice to meet you. I am Rajnil Mukherjee, a 2nd year undergrad at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (IISER), Mohali, Punjab, India. I was born and brought up in the beautiful city of Kolkata, and completed my high school from there itself. I am an aspiring astrophysicist, the drummer in my college rock band and currently the co-convener of Turing-the Computer Club of IISER Mohali. </p>

				<p>As said before, I am an aspiring astrophysicst. However, unlike other astro geeks out there, my GK is very bad, so don't expect me to go answer queries like what that star that is--I don't know okay? Catalogues are there for a reason. I am a prospective physics major, and you can learn more about my projects and experiences here:</p>

					<h3>What's up?</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Well, right now I am at Bangalore for the summer, doing a project on possible Fermi Bubble analogs under Dr. Santanu Mondal here at the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA). And I am really sorry to say this Bangalore peeps, the food conditions I have experienced here is terrible. I miss home, and unbelievably, the hostel mess.*sob*</p>

					<h3>Jobless after classes?</h3>
				</header>
				<p>Sometimes I wish I was. I am a very avid drummer, and play with my friends as a part of a band in my college. I also dabble in front-end web development, and watch a lot of anime. I used to read a lot too, but it kind of stopped sometime during my +2. However, I have started picking it up again here in Bangalore, so less gooo!  </p>
