Hey, so I took a special page to describe my hobbies. This is because I feel that hobbies are a very important part of a person's life, and we should as a society learn to celebrate them more. 

## Music 
Yeah so one of my biggest hobbies is playing drums. I am a very avid player, and play with my friends in a rock band. I have been playing for some time now, and hope to continue doing so in the future.

## Front-end Web Development
I dabble a bit in front end. That is how I got this site up :). I am pretty new though, and currently with the help of my friend Rishi @ IISER I am making sites for clubs. 

## Reading
I used to be a voracious reader once, but had to kind of give up on that because of . I read a lot of books, and I am currently trying to read more non-fiction. I am also trying to read more books by Indian authors.

## Anime 
Yeah I like watching anime. Don't judge me. And also, don't ask me my top 5, 10, or anything. I don't maintain a MAL.
