Hey, so I took a special page to describe my hobbies. This is because I feel that hobbies are a very important part of a person's life, and we should as a society learn to celebrate them more. 

## Music 
Yeah so one of my biggest hobbies is playing drums. I am a very avid player, and play with my friends in a rock band called Ulysses. I have been playing for some time now, and hope to continue doing so in the future.

My music taste is quite...bipolar, you can say. I listen to a lot of rock and heavy metal like Slipknot and all, but also bands such as Jatayu, Thaikuddam Bridge, Swastik and Aurthohin. I listen to a lot of anime music and J-Pop as well, along with the occasional bollywood. 

In short, I listen to a lot of things. If you feel you want to recommend me something good, you can do so without hesitation! Just drop me a text and we can vibe together! 

## Anime 
Yeah I like watching anime. Don't judge me. And also, don't ask me my top 5, 10, or anything. I don't maintain a MAL. And everything in this world is a Gintama reference. Just watch it. It will teach you how to live.

## Reading
I used to be a voracious reader once, but had to kind of give up on that because of my high school curriculum. I am picking that up again though. Lately, I have been drawn to a bit of dysoptia and books like "1984", "The Handmaid's Tale" etc. You can recommend me some good books as well, I would love to read them!
